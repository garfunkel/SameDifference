# SameDifference
Identifies similar videos and images.

## Description
SameDifference is a program that lets you identify similar or identical video and image files. It achieves this regardless of how the files are encoded, aspect ratio, framerate, resolution, or quality.

SameDifference supports hundreds of video and image formats. It does this by packing the extremely powerful FFmpeg software library under the hood, which gives SameDifference enourmous flexibility and power. If your videos and images do not work in SameDifference, then they are probably not going to work anywhere else either!
